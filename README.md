# Decoupled Adversarial Contrastive Learning for Self-supervised Adversarial Robustness (Accepted by ECCV2022 oral presentation)

Chaoning Zhang, Kang Zhang, Chenshuang Zhang, Axi Niu, Jiu Feng, Chang D. Yoo, In So Kweon


Overall framework of DeACL. It consists of two stages. At stage 1, DeACL performs a standard SSL to obtain a non-robust encoder. At stage 2, the pretrained encoder act as a teacher model to generate pseudo-targets for guiding a supervised AT on a student model. After two stages of training, the student model is the model of our interest.

# ðŸ”§ Enviroment

Please refer [solo-learn](https://github.com/vturrisi/solo-learn) to install the enviroment for detail.

> First clone the repo.
> 
> Then, to install solo-learn with Dali and/or UMAP support, use:
> 
> `pip3 install .[dali,umap,h5] --extra-index-url https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist`

# âš¡ Training

## 1. prepare the pretrained self-supervised model
You can download pretrained checkpoint from [solo-learn](https://github.com/vturrisi/solo-learn#cifar-10) or train by yourself. 

SimCLR model pretrained by solo-learn [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mcvWr8P2WNJZ7TVpdLHA_Q91q4VK3y8O?usp=sharing).

## 2. Train DeACL with ResNet18 on CIFAR10 dataset

Using the file `bash_files\DeACL_cifar10_resnet18.sh`. You need to specific the `--project xxx`, `--entity xxx`, and add `--wandb` to enable wandb logging.

## 3. Test the robustness of PGD and AutoAttack with full precision 

`python adv_slf.py --ckpt CKPT_PATH`


This code is developed based on [solo-learn](https://github.com/vturrisi/solo-learn) for training and [AdvCL](https://github.com/LijieFan/AdvCL.git) for testing.
